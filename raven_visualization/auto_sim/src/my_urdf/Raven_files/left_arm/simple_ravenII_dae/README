upload original, full detail filename.dae to blender
export as .dae (some weird but necessary conversion here)
import into meshlab
    Filters->Remeshing, Simplification, ...->Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation
        set target # of faces (1/4th of original for cases in this folder)
        keep defaults except
            Quality threshold->1.0
            set all checkboxes except "Simiplify only selected faces"
        Apply
